    <h2>Let's talk basketball</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- At least 200 words descriptive text -->
     Basketball has been my favorite sport for a couple years now. Personally I've always been interested in games of strategy, and basketball is the major sport that greatest exmplifies that quality to me. 
     Different players have greatly different skills and seeing how coaches and players themselves best optimize combinations of these skills to win games is extremely interesting to me. 
     There are so many ways a player can be useful, many of which do not show up in the regular counting stats(points,rebs,assists).
     You can be a horrible scorer but a good defender, or a high scorer and terrible teammate, or any different archetype of player.
     What's interesting is that a lot of winning qualities don't show up in the stats casual viewers typically look at, leading to a mass public misperception of certain players.
     The psychological aspect of basketball is also intreguing to me. The way that narratives take root and public perception of coaches or players sways in often-times statistically inaccurate directions is extremely interesting.
     The idea that a point in the 4th quarter is equal to a point in the first quarter seems self-evident, but in the basketball world, even among intelligent people, we see a great emphasis on the "clutchness" of a player.
     There is so much to study with Basketball, and I truly reccommend getting into it whether you care about stats, psychology, or just entertaining games.
