      <!-- intro -->
      Hello, my name is Luke Kreysar. Some of my interests are basketball, esports, and coding, and music. On this website I'll specifically talk
      about basketball. I first got into it quite late, during the 2021-2022 season. I first started paying attention to sports after I was reccommended 
      a documentary about the mariners from John Bois(which is an amazing video I would reccommend to anyone). From there, I started watching YouTube videos about basketball 
      stats, and started to understand the game at a higher level. I would end up playing a bit in intermural(to low success), and being a nerd about it ever since.
      My favorite player is Lebron James(who is the best player of all time), and my favorite team is currently the Nuggets.
      I also enjoy watching different esports, even getting to Korea to see the Valorant world championship, and hopefully going to the League of Legends one this year.
      It's fun for me to analyze or play any sort of game of strategy or thinking, which is something I've been doing since really young. 
      My cat Tommy Z is pictured at the bottom. He's 5 years old and we picked him out when a neighbor's cat had kittens when he was smaller than your hand.
      He is a monster who would routinely bring back random animals as offerings, but thankfully the wilderness is safe from him now that he lives in an apartment.
